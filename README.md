      i'm not often talkative but i don't mind holding up a conversation, my social battery may run out very quickly depending on how i feel, please don't feel like it was your fault, haha. i'm sadly also not so good at responding to people, so forgive me if i take forever to respond to you, please don't bug me about it.

      besides that, i really love chance (forsaken), astro (dw), and more that are listend. i'm literally chance, i fear. i generally like roblox (especially write a letter and forsaken.)

      i also hold music close to my heart, it's the way i express myself, i'm music's #1 fan. i love almost every single type of music, you'd have to give me a genre if you'd want my favorite song. but my interests are primarily from roblox and anime.
