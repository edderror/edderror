<p align="center"> I’m an INFP-T. I have ADHD, so my brain’s pretty creative and fast-paced, sometimes a little scattered, but always buzzing with ideas and feelings. Perhaps i maybe have C-PTSD, which means I’m healing from some tough stuff and learning how to handle big emotions and memories. Even though i've been through some hard things in life, i prefer to keep thoose parts private.
I like teasing my friends bcz?? why not tho, theyre cool. 

<p align="center">I’m really into multiple fandoms like Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, Forsaken on Roblox, ALNST, and more. I’m a big multishipper too.
