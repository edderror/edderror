    <p align="center" Hello

<p align="center">I’m Edd.
I have ADHD and PTSD make me act in ways I can’t always control sometimes I vanish into silence, sometimes I explode w feelings I can’t contain.

<p align="center">I’m sorry if that makes me hard to deal with.

<p align="center">But all of that… I still love with everything in me. I love my boyfriend Hatchet w my whole heart. And I also love my friends, I love music, bcz it says the words I can’t. I love characters like Chance and Astro, because they remind me I’m not alone in how I feel. I love soft, emotional moments the kind that make me feel alive and seen.

<p align="center">I may be quiet, awkward, or tired. I may draw, edit, and create slowly, but it’s because I put pieces of myself into everything I make. I may seem distant, but I’m always there, always caring, always thinking.

<p align="center">C+H are fine with me, so I don’t really mind.
I don’t mind hanging out with my friends, but these days I just don’t meet people like I used to.
I get overwhelmed easily and feel sad if something goes wrong.

<p align="center">Vent.
<p align="center">I cry over things I feel are stupid. I overthink until my head hurts. I get paranoid and start questioning if people are lying, even when I don’t want to.
I overthink a lot, and my emotions get heavy. Sometimes I don’t know how to handle them, but I still care deeply. I love with my whole heart, even if it makes me feel broken sometimes.
