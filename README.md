<p align="center">i go by edd / edderror. i’m not subtle about caring if i love someone, it shows. 
  i’m expressive, affectionate, and kind of intense about the people that matter to me. i don’t really care about being 
<p align="center">socially aware or doing things the “right” way if it doesn’t feel honest.
<p align="center">i’m dreamy but not stupid. poetic but still grounded. i get attached deeply 
  and i don’t let go easily. loyalty isn’t optional for me it’s the bare minimum.

<p align="center">i’m into character kinning. i like writing,,
<p align="center">i work on things slowly but intentionally. 
  school exists, stress exists, but i still make room for what i love.
<p align="center">music matters to me more than i admit. it’s 
  how i process things i don’t want to say out loud. i latch onto songs the same way i latch onto people emotionally, 
  obsessively, on loop. certain lyrics feel like they were written at me, not for me. 
  i don’t just listen to music, i live in it.
<p align="center">i get tired easily, and my sleep is kind of shit sometimes. i do try to go 
<p align="center">also, i’m into anime,, i really like bungo stray dogs. i also like genshin, hsr, and project sekai / pjs, alien stage. i’m in other fandoms too,,like forsaken (i’m forgetting some). i struggle with adhd and cptsd sometimes, and i also deal with memory loss.
  to sleep at the right time, but i’m also busy with school.
